    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I was born in San Angelo, Tx. A small town in the west Texas region. I graduated high school in 2007 and immediately attended a private aviation school to become a pilot.
        I ended up staying for two years before moving to Dallas where I discovered my love for technology.
